#### `Sample Output`

```
90411 Joe
```

#### `Explanation`

Hacker 86870 got a score of 30 for challenge 71055 with a difficulty level of 2, so 86870 earned a full score for this challenge.

Hacker 90411 got a score of 30 for challenge 71055 with a difficulty level of 2, so 90411 earned a full score for this challenge.

Hacker 90411 got a score of 100 for challenge 66730 with a difficulty level of 6, so 90411 earned a full score for this challenge.

Only hacker 90411 managed to earn a full score for more than one challenge, so we print the their hacker_id and name as 2 space-separated values.
