Write a query identifying the type of each record in the `TRIANGLES` table using its three side lengths. Output one of the following statements for each record in the table:

- **Equilateral** : It's a triangle with 3 sides of equal length.

- **Isosceles** : It's a triangle with 2 sides of equal length.

- **Scalene** : It's a triangle with 3 sides of differing lenghts.

- **Not A Triangle** : The given values of A, B, and C don't form a triangle.

#### `Input Format`

The `TRIANGLES` table is described as follows:

|Column|Type|
|:--|:--|
|A|Integer|
|B|Integer|
|C|Integer|
<br>

Each row in the table denotes the lengths of each of a triangle's three sides.

#### `Sample Input`

|A|B|C|
|:--|:--|:--|
|20|20|23|
|20|20|20|
|20|21|22|
|13|14|30|
<br>

#### `Sample Output`

Isosceles

Equilateral

Scalene

Not A Triangle

#### `Explanation`

Values in the tuple (20, 20, 23) form an Isosceles triangle, because A ≡ B.
Values in the tuple (20, 20, 20) form an Equilateral triangle, because A ≡ B ≡ C. Values in the tuple (20, 21, 22) form a Scalene triangle, because A ≠ B ≠ C.
Values in the tuple (13, 14, 30) cannot form a triangle because the combined value of sides A and B is not larger than that of side C.
